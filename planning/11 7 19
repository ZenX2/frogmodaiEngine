I want to refactor the main game loop to be initiated by player input always
The player's inputs should each send off a chain of events that plays out an entire cycle
When the turn manager returns to the player, the chains are ended and input is awaited to begin again
Right now with the whole keystoke thing, it's all kinds of fucked up

It's no longer making sense to me why you would want to have systems processing in the normal way....
Or in an arbitrary order??/ aaauughe

Right now all/most events are spawning off of TimeSystem???
so everything after that is after the bulk of the action!

The processing system as it is seems like it runs everything way too often
Or maybe that means I'm using it wrong
It seems to work for that cookie baking example

Controlling the order that event subscribers get called???
They should be structured so it doesn't matter!

The player's position seems to lag behind a frame!!! what!!!
