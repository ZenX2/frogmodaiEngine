	I am but a hobbyist magician, hiding away in my magician's cave. My name is Ribotus Carland (the Third), latest in the line of mad explorers and experimenters. I work at my benchtop Personal Incanter, which can process chants and mantras at up to 3 kilowords/second, for any magical focusing needs. In Spell Processors, I devise forumlae for generating chants towards specifically intended purposes. 

Something magic can do: channel and amplify conscious focus, on the user's behalf.
Something magic can't do: anything beyond following the recipe
A price/toll that using magic incurs: blood instead of electricity??? (is blood magic cliched?)
What it feels like to do magic

	I was working at my PI one day processing some gnarly cantrips, when I first slippede through the membrane. One moment I was here, the next moment, there was no I at all. 

	I have has strange visions of other worlds... where lightning spells are confined to tiny tubes to process calculations rather than incantations. I can't quite comprehend what this would entail, but it is a captivating thought nonetheless.

	I felt a strange nagging at the back of my mind. A hint of a memory, and impression of an impression. It painted my world in strokes so broad that it can be fully apprehend at no individual point. 

	Just as a Personal Computer works via communicating its arrangement of impersonal electrons to the user via a photon interface, a Personal Incanter works via communicating its arrangment of impersonal consciousness-units to the user via a [magical particle? etheric? "etheron"?] interface.

	[How do video games work in this world??? Are there magical games? Does that make sense? Are they more like words games?]
	[Magical competitive games?? Games based around crafting spells?] 
	[What human social/psychological structures are human games built around? What would frog games be built around?]
	[What kind of tasks were computers developed for originally? To what functions have they been reterritorialized to since then?]

	[What is the personality of this character?]
	[What are foil/complimentary/opposing personalities?]
	[What are the opposing story roles? For the antagonist?]
	[What are the communities these characters are in? What are the internal conflicts within these communities? What are the external conflicts between these communities? What are the existential conflicts between the communities as a whole and the worlds/systems they inhabit?]

	[If I was a frog, I would have a family structures based around the dynamics of frog reproduction.]
	[If I had that family structure, it would tend towards a certain form of sociopolitical structure, based on the interaction of the values of the interacting family groups.]
